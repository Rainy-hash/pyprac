Geometric solver:
-Provides functions/formulas to solve basic formulas for circles, squares, and triangles
-TESTS.py was created to validate that the functions in units.py work as intended

This is my first Python project, took a bit less than a week and it was fairly challenging here and there, it initally begin with just units.py and it was a simple print-out file. 
When I had found out about test files I wanted to recreate it and apply it, I hadn't realized until then how much I was going to have to alter, shrink, and repeat. I will make another like this and attempt to shrink it just a bit more.
